So just to keep things running smoothly, please avoid using <users/all> from now on. We don’t want the chats getting nuked again! 🙏
If you need to reach a lot of people, feel free to drop a message normally — just skip the tag. Thanks, everyone! 🚀 \nP.S. Don't click this link: https://tinyurl.com/dont-click295250`,
